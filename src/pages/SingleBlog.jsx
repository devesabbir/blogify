            Today I was mob programming with Square&apos;s Mobile &amp;
            Performance Reliability team and we toyed with an interesting idea.
            Our codebase has classes that represent screens a user can navigate
            to. These classes are defined in modules, and these modules have an
            owner team defined. When navigating to a screen, we wanted to have
            the owner team information available, at runtime. We created a build
            tool that looks at about 1000 Screen classes, determines the owner
            team, and generates a class to do the lookup at runtime. The
            generated code looked like this:
            <br />
            mapOf(vararg pairs: Pair) is a nice utility to create a map (more
            specifically, a LinkedHashMap) but using that syntax leads to the
            creation of a temporary vararg array of size 1000, as well as 1000
            temporary Pair instances. Memory hoarding Let&apos;s look at the
            retained size of the map we just created: ~30 characters per class
            name * 2 bytes per character = 60 bytes per entry Each entry is
            stored as a LinkedHashMapEntry which adds 2 references to
            HashMap.Node which itself holds 3 references and 1 int. On a 64bit
            VM that&apos;s 5 references * 8 bytes, plus 4 bytes for the int: 44
            bytes per entry. So for the entries alone we&apos;re at (60 + 44) *
            1000 = 104 KB. The default load factor is 75%, which means the size
            of the array backing the hashmap must always be at least 25% greater
            than the number of entries. And the array size has to be a factor of
            2. So, for 1000 entries, that&apos;s an object array of size 2048:
            2048 * 8 = 16,314 bytes. The total retained size of the map is ~120
            KB. Can we do better? Could we make it... 0?
            <h2 className="font-bold text-3xl mt-4">100% code-based map</h2>
            What if we generate code that returns the right team for a given
            screen, instead of creating a map? Since we know the full list of
            screen classes, we can check ahead of time whether there&apos;s any
            hashcode conflict, and if not, we can generate code that directly
